Many people have asked us why are you buying this book and not this book? As you have guessed the simple answer is demand. Given that we buy seventy percent of the books we take in cash up front. We need to be very certain that the book will sell otherwise we will be sitting large write off and debts. Therefore our buyers have to constantly forecast demand and change their buying decisions accordingly.
<br/>

The first thing we look at is the prescribed book list. As I have mentioned in my other blog many lecturers either send this information late or refuse to give it to us because they have preserved it for some other preferred bookstore. If your lecturer does not provide us with the prescribed book for your course then we cannot buy that book. 
However when we have received reliable prescribed book information we are able to start buying the book from the students.
<br/>

The other issue is changes in edition. As you know by now publishers like this thing of changing the edition of the book, which often means  the same content with a new cover and a higher price. Pimp My Book does buy old editions if there is a demand for them. We have found that senior students tend to know this change in edition trick and therefore purchase older editions because its much cheaper. However freshers always want to purchase the latest edition as instructed by the teacher.
<br/>

Lastly we also look at our current stock levels. So if we have a lot of stock of that book we are unlikely to purchase it cash. This is why it is always advisable to sell your book as soon as you are done using it.

NSFAS now pays allowances straight into students' bank accounts 
<br/>


If you are funded by NSFAS you probably aware that NSFAS is paying you your allowance straight into your bank account and not through a restricted card. For those who have never been funded by NSFAS let me break it down for you. So NSFAS used to put students allowances into cards that were restricted to approved vendors such as book stores and grocery stores. This was to ensure that students only spend the money on what it was intended for. This year NSFAS stopped that control method and gave students their cash directly.
<br/>

Booksellers across the country lost about 30% of sales after this decision was made. Many bookstores are closing stores and retrenching staff in order to survive.  My prediction is that this development is going to further consolidate a highly concentrated book market. The smaller bookstores such as Pimp My Book are more nimble and entrepreneurial and will have to respond by changing their product offering to meet the new needs of students. Bookstores will have to stock other products which students are interested in buying. Failure to do this will cause may of the smaller bookstores to shut down or get swallowed by one of the bigger bookstores. The big bookstores are already closing some of their bookstores but they should still be able to survive.
<br/>

Ultimately this move will reduce the number of bookstores and the number of books carried by bookstores. This might not be a bad thing if you consider that textbooks are no longer as useful as they used to be. So perhaps we do not need a much smaller supply of books in South Africa.
