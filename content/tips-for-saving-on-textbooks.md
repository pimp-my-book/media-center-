I think all students will agree that textbooks are quite expensive. The average new textbooks costs around seven hundred rands for a single copy. As a current and former student who has also sold textbooks for the last thirteen years I would like to share some tips on saving on textbooks.

## 1. Check if you really need the book
I always ask people to go into one of our Pimp My Book stores and try to differentiate between a brand new and second hand book. Most people cant tell the difference because most of the used textbooks look brand new. The reality is that many students are wasting money purchasing textbooks which they hardly use.

This is the biggest mistake most students, especially freshers, make when they buy textbooks. Do not just rush to purchase textbooks without checking if you really need them.

## 2.   Check if the book is prescribed or recommended 

You need to check with your lecturer if the book is prescribed or recommended for your course. If the book is prescribed it is likely that you might need it but does not necessarily mean it will always be useful. You still need to ask your lecturer if you really need the book. Remember that some lecturers prescribe books out of habit and not need. If the book is recommended this means that it is useful to have but not necessary. In this case I would advise that you wait and see if the material provided by your lecturer is sufficient before purchasing a textbook. 

Our bursary platform (www.gogoa.co.za) has saved our clients millions of rands by simply providing them with tools to check whether a book is prescribed or simply recommended.

## 3. Get the book second hand

You probably think that I am being biased  as I am the founder of Pimp My Book. The truth is that second hand textbooks are on average 30% cheaper than new books, so it is a no brainer. 

Always check if you know someone who used the book the previous year and could simply give you the book for free. Many students get too busy to get rid of their books and some want to keep them for sentimental reasons. So you could just ask to borrow the book for the semester. However if you do not know anyone who has the book then you can visit one of our stores.
