TIPS FOR SAVING ON TEXTBOOKS

I think all students will agree that textbooks are quite expensive. The average new textbooks costs around seven hundred rands for a single copy. As a current and former student who has also sold textbooks for the last thirteen years I would like to share some tips on saving on textbooks.

Check if you really need the book
I always ask people to go into one of our Pimp My Book stores and try to differentiate between a brand new and second hand book. Most people cant tell the difference because most of the used textbooks look brand new. The reality is that many students are wasting money purchasing textbooks which they hardly use.

This is the biggest mistake most students, especially freshers, make when they buy textbooks. Do not just rush to purchase textbooks without checking if you really need them.

2.   Check if the book is prescribed or recommended 

You need to check with your lecturer if the book is prescribed or recommended for your course. If the book is prescribed it is likely that you might need it but does not necessarily mean it will always be useful. You still need to ask your lecturer if you really need the book. Remember that some lecturers prescribe books out of habit and not need. If the book is recommended this means that it is useful to have but not necessary. In this case I would advise that you wait and see if the material provided by your lecturer is sufficient before purchasing a textbook. 

Our bursary platform (www.gogoa.co.za) has saved our clients millions of rands by simply providing them with tools to check whether a book is prescribed or simply recommended.

3. Get the book second hand

You probably think that I am being biased  as I am the founder of Pimp My Book. The truth is that second hand textbooks are on average 30% cheaper than new books, so it is a no brainer. 

Always check if you know someone who used the book the previous year and could simply give you the book for free. Many students get too busy to get rid of their books and some want to keep them for sentimental reasons. So you could just ask to borrow the book for the semester. However if you do not know anyone who has the book then you can visit one of our stores.


WHY ARE TEXTBOOKS SO EXPENSIVE?

So what actually makes university textbooks so expensive? You will often hear people blaming the greedy monopoly “almost wrote ……. Monopoly Capital” bookstores for the high cost of textbooks. I must be honest and say that the largest textbook retailer in South Africa, Van Schaik Bookstores, has sometimes been unfairlyblamed for the high cost of textbooks.

Bookselling makes 30% of the overall cost of the textbook. The two major costs of running a bookstore are rents and salaries. Ironically many universities are seemingly worried about the high cost of textbooks while still charging very high rentals for space on campus. The book sector is extremely seasonal but universities and private landlords still charge rentals over the long holiday seasons. Another major cost is the salaries of the people in the bookstores. It is easy for someone to say the bookstores are making a lot of money. I have been in this sector for 13 years and I have never met a rich academic bookseller, if you know one please connect as I would like to learn how they do it. 

One of the major costs to bookstores is unsold stock which they have to write off. Universities are nautorius for holding back or sending information about books required for the next semester very late. Most bookstores need to order their books about three months in advance. There is a culture of hiding and protecting information about textbooks required. Some lecturers will tell you that they only give to a specific bookstores and many will send you up and down as though you are asking for a solution paper the day before an exam. The culture of hiding book lists or preserving them for  “preferred” bookstores needs to end if we want to reduce the cost of textbooks.

The other major costs are publisher costs and royalties. Now I do not know much about publishers but I can tell you that seventy percent of the costs have already been added before the book arrives at the bookstore. One of the problems with the sector is that publishers “approach” lecturers to convince them to prescribe their textbook. Once the book is prescribed the publishers is almost guaranteed sales. This is the reason that many publishers get the lecturer to author a book which the lecturer then goes on to prescribe. Don't be surprised if you find your lecturer forcing you to buy their book.

The problem with the lecturer/publisher relationship is that it does not seem as though the student is included in this value chain. How many publishers can you name off the top of your head? Not many….. This is because publishers do not invest a lot of time into connecting with students even though you are the ones buying their books.

Honestly I do not think the blame can be put on any one party. I think there needs to be a change in business model within this sector. E-books should be removing the printing, distribution and book selling costs, but the adoption of e-books is very low. Ultimately the high cost of textbooks is actually leading to the death of textbooks. The reality is that students no longer rely on textbooks as their only source of information because there is so much current information available online. With textbooks being so expensive while becoming less relevant, the future of the entire industry is at risk.
