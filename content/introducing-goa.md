Our mission has always been to help students to afford the tools that they need to succeed in their studies. More than 50% of students in South Africa are funded by NSFAS, bursaries and scholarships. Therefore  it is not enough to help students but we also have to help those who help students. We found that most bursaries were struggling to manage the procurement of textbooks for their students and also the cost of textbooks was an ever increasing problem.


<br/>

I firmly believed that the model used by bursaries to procure academic materials for their students was inefficient. Most bursaries give their students a cash lump sum directly or they give the student a credit at one of the bookstores for the same amount. The problem with both these methods is that the lump sum amount is not based on the amount required by that specific students. So inevitable most students end up getting more money than what they need while some get less. 


<br/>

GOA was is a web application that solves this problem by giving bursaries the tools which they need to manage their budgets. GOA ensures that students order according to the bursaries mandates and their needs. Bursaries can mandate that only prescribed books or second hand are supplied to their students. Students are then restricted to ordering textbooks which are prescribed for that particular course. Students order online and are able to track or change their order online. 


<br/>

Within a year, GOA has more than 1000 users on the platform. We have saved our clients millions of rands while still ensuring that each student gets all the materials which they need to succeed.



<br/>


I know that some students may feel that GOA is built to benefit the bursaries at their cost. I believe that as students we need to support endeavors that save our sponsors money. This money is usually used to further support the existing students or to fund more students. If we think about all those students who still do not have sufficient funding for their fees we will realize that it is not a bad thing to miss out on some cool clothes in order to help another student.
