The other day I was in a meeting with one of our bursary clients and she mentioned how she can't recall a student coming back to say thank you for helping me through varsity. I realized that I am also guilty as I never said thanks to FNB/Career Wise for my undergrad bursary and The Bertha Centre for Social Innovation for my masters scholarship. I might have said it in passing but I really do not remember formally expressing my gratitude.


<br/>


Sometimes we can feel entitled to all the support we receive. I am sure there are many people saying it is the government's/NSFAS duty to fund students. Someone else will say but the companies are not doing this out of their kind hearts. They are receiving BEE points or some other kind of CSI points. Yes you might think that you deserve it anyway because you worked hard so that you can be awarded your bursary. 

<br/>

That is true but you also need to realise that it is not every government in the world that offers funding for students. As smart as you think you are, there were many students that could have received that bursary instead of you. Also many of these organisations are extremely  committed to your success. Each time I meet with a potential client I am  inspired by the genuine passion for helping students which they display.


<br/>

Make time to contact the organisation that funded you and thank them. You could go even further and offer your time as a mentor to one of the current students. Simply ask them what if there is anything you could help with.
