So what actually makes university textbooks so expensive? You will often hear people blaming the greedy monopoly “almost wrote ……. Monopoly Capital” bookstores for the high cost of textbooks. I must be honest and say that the largest textbook retailer in South Africa, Van Schaik Bookstores, has sometimes been unfairlyblamed for the high cost of textbooks.

<br/>

[Here is a an outlook from the SA Book Council](http://sabookcouncil.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Cost-of-books-study.pdf)


<br/>



Bookselling makes 30% of the overall cost of the textbook. The two major costs of running a bookstore are rents and salaries. Ironically many universities are seemingly worried about the high cost of textbooks while still charging very high rentals for space on campus. The book sector is extremely seasonal but universities and private landlords still charge rentals over the long holiday seasons. Another major cost is the salaries of the people in the bookstores. It is easy for someone to say the bookstores are making a lot of money. I have been in this sector for 13 years and I have never met a rich academic bookseller, if you know one please connect as I would like to learn how they do it. 

<br/>



One of the major costs to bookstores is unsold stock which they have to write off. Universities are nautorius for holding back or sending information about books required for the next semester very late. Most bookstores need to order their books about three months in advance. There is a culture of hiding and protecting information about textbooks required. Some lecturers will tell you that they only give to a specific bookstores and many will send you up and down as though you are asking for a solution paper the day before an exam. The culture of hiding book lists or preserving them for  “preferred” bookstores needs to end if we want to reduce the cost of textbooks.


<br/>


The other major costs are publisher costs and royalties. Now I do not know much about publishers but I can tell you that seventy percent of the costs have already been added before the book arrives at the bookstore. One of the problems with the sector is that publishers “approach” lecturers to convince them to prescribe their textbook. Once the book is prescribed the publishers is almost guaranteed sales. This is the reason that many publishers get the lecturer to author a book which the lecturer then goes on to prescribe. Don't be surprised if you find your lecturer forcing you to buy their book.


<br/>


The problem with the lecturer/publisher relationship is that it does not seem as though the student is included in this value chain. How many publishers can you name off the top of your head? Not many….. This is because publishers do not invest a lot of time into connecting with students even though you are the ones buying their books.


<br/>


Honestly I do not think the blame can be put on any one party. I think there needs to be a change in business model within this sector. E-books should be removing the printing, distribution and book selling costs, but the adoption of e-books is very low. Ultimately the high cost of textbooks is actually leading to the death of textbooks. The reality is that students no longer rely on textbooks as their only source of information because there is so much current information available online. With textbooks being so expensive while becoming less relevant, the future of the entire industry is at risk.
