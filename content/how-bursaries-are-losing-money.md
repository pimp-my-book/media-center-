Millions of rands have been pumped into education but many organisations are simply wasting money, especially on book allowances. One of our clients was wasting more than one million rands per annum on their book allowances.



<br/>

Most bursaries give students a set annual budget for textbooks each year or semester. This number I assume is based on historical data or amounts that have been made available by their trustees. The problem is that this figure is often not based on what each student actually requires. So you find that in most instances five thousand rands has been made available for students who do not even need a book for their course or need far less than that. There are even cases where students need more money than the amount allocated by their bursary. Therefore money is being wasted on many students while some do not get everything they need.



<br/>

Another secret that most bursaries do not realise is that book prescriptions at universities have generally come down over the years. Tenn years ago students did need the entire five or seven thousand budgeted because a textbook was the only source of information. The internet has made up to date content available at no cost. Most students these days would rather google something when they stuck than to refer to a textbook. Due to the high cost of textbooks, universities have asked lecturers to only prescribe textbooks if  they are necessary for the course. This is one of the reasons why lecturers only prescribe textbooks if it's impossible for students to get through the course without it. Most textbooks these days are actually recommended and not prescribed and for many courses there is not textbook at all, lectures provide notes. 


<br/>

The problem facing bursaries is how do they then determine who needs a book or not. The only way is to get data of what books are prescribed for each course and only provide textbooks when its necessary. This is a lot of admin to do but the data can be aggregated and made available to a number of bursaries. 


<br/>

This is precisely why we developed our bursary platform GOA. GOA aggregates book prescription data and ensures that students only receive books that are actually prescribed for their courses. We have saved our clients millions of rands, money that has been used to help more students in need. In fact one of our clients purchased each of her students a laptop with the savings they made. Therefore each student got the book that is prescribed for their course plus a laptop within the same budget that was only used for textbooks the previous year.
